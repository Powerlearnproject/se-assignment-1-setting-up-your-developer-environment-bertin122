     ```

 4. Installing Development Tools
   -Visual Studio Code
     - Download the .deb package from the [official VSCode website](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
     - Install VSCode:
       ```bash
       sudo dpkg -i code*.deb
       sudo apt install -f  
       ```
   - Git

     ```
     - Configure Git:
       ```bash
       git config --global user.name "Your Name"
       git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
       ```

 5. Setting Up Version Control
- GitHub
     - Create a GitHub account if you donâ€™t have one.
     - Generate SSH keys:
       ```bash
       ```
       - Add the SSH key to the ssh-agent:
         ```bash
         eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
         ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
         ```
       - Add the SSH key to your GitHub account by copying the key and pasting it into your GitHub SSH settings:
         ```bash
         cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
         ```

 6. Programming Languages and Frameworks
   - Python
     ```bash
     sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
     ```
     - Create a virtual environment:
       ```bash
       python3 -m venv myenv
       source myenv/bin/activate
       ```
     - Install necessary packages:
       ```bash
       pip install numpy pandas flask django
       ```
   - Node.js and np
     ```bash
     curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
     sudo apt install -y nodejs
     ```
   - Java:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
     ```

 7. Database Setup

     ```bash
     sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
     sudo -i -u postgres
     createuser --interactive
     createdb mydatabase
     ```

 8. Configuring IDE Extensions
   - VSCode Extensions
     - Python
     - Prettier - Code formatter
     - ESLint
     - GitLens
     - Docker
     - Live Server
   - Settings
     - Configure settings in `settings.json`:
       ```json
       {
         "editor.tabSize": 4,
         "editor.formatOnSave": true,
         "files.autoSave": "afterDelay",
         "python.pythonPath": "myenv/bin/python"
       }
       ```

 9. Containerization
   - Docker
     ```bash
     sudo apt install docker.io
     sudo systemctl start docker
     sudo systemctl enable docker
     sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
     ```

       ```
   - Docker Compose
     ```bash
     sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
     sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
     ```

 10. Troubleshooting Steps
   - Fixing Dependency Issues
     - If you encounter dependency issues, use:
       ```bash
       sudo apt --fix-broken install
       ```
   - Resolving Permission Issues
     - If you face permission issues with Docker, ensure the user is added to the Docker group:
       ```bash
       sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}
       ```
   - Common Python Errors
     - If there are issues with pip packages, ensure `pip` is updated:
       ```bash
       pip install --upgrade pip
       ```

 11. Customizations
   - Bash Aliases
     - Add useful aliases to `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:
       ```bash
       alias ll='ls -alF'
       alias la='ls -A'
       alias l='ls -CF'
       alias gs='git status'
       alias gd='git diff'
       ```
     - Apply changes:
       ```bash
       source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
       ```
   - Prompt Customization
     - Customize the command prompt by adding the following to `.bashrc`:
       ```bash
